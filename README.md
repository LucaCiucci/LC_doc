# LC_doc
 Clang based documentation generator


This is a quite simple documentation generenator that uses [*libclang*](https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/group__CINDEX.html) and an extensible *Markdown* syntax.

At the moment, it only supports C++ but it could be extended to other languages in the future.
